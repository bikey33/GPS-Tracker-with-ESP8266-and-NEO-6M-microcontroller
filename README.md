# GPS-Tracker-with-ESP8266-and-NEO-6M-microcontroller
I made a simple GPS tracker device for a car-rental system using NEO-6m GPS module and ESP8266 controller. I pushed the data obtained from the NEO-6M GPS module to the web server and hosted database using ESP8266. I used ESP8266 module to send the POST request to server using a PHP API. Latitude and longitude information of the car was sent to the database every 2 minutes by this GPS tracker. I will provide you with the Arduino Code uploaded to the ESP8266 as well as the code for Laravel API used throughout this project, in this repository.
